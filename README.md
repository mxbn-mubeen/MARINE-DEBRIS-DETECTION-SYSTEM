# MARINE-DEBRIS-DETECTION-SYSTEM-


This repository contains the implementation of a Marine Debris Detection System, designed to classify and identify marine debris in images using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preparation, image augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

Repository Structure
Data Preparation

Splitting Data: Scripts for splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
Image Augmentation: Scripts for augmenting images to enhance the diversity of the training dataset.
Model Training

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Implementation of a CNN model for classifying images as debris or non-debris.
Training Script: Code for training the CNN model on the augmented dataset.
Evaluation Script: Code for evaluating the trained CNN model using various metrics.
Model Evaluation

Confusion Matrix: Visualization of the model's performance.
F1 Score: Calculation of the F1 score to evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, and recall.
Object Identification (Future Work)

Clarifai API Integration: Planned integration with the Clarifai API for object identification within images.
Voila App: Planned development of an interactive Voila app to upload images and display classification results.
