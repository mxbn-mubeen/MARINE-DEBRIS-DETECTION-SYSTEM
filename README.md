# MARINE-DEBRIS-DETECTION-SYSTEM-


Your Marine Debris Detection System project is impressive! Let's dive into the details of each component:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The "Splitting Data" scripts are crucial for dividing your dataset into training, testing, and validation sets. Proper data splitting ensures robust model performance.
   - "Image Augmentation" scripts enhance dataset diversity by creating variations of existing images. This helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Implementing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is an excellent choice for image classification. CNNs learn hierarchical features from images effectively.
   - Your "Training Script" trains the CNN model using the augmented dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters and monitor training progress.
   - The "Evaluation Script" assesses the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the **F1 score**.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The "Confusion Matrix" visually represents model predictions (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives).
   - The **F1 score** balances precision and recall. Aim for a high F1 score to achieve both accuracy and completeness.

4. **Object Identification (Future Work):**
   - Integrating the **Clarifai API** for object identification within images is exciting. It can enhance your system's capabilities by identifying specific debris types.
   - Developing an interactive **Voila app** for image upload and classification results will make your project user-friendly.

5. **Project Database:**
   - Access the dataset via the **[Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_zXqFG5J3rW07aRHf-NclbIePtdtbzOP?usp=drive_link)** for transparency and reproducibility.
